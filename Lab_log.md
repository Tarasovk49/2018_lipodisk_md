**Analysis of trajectory 1h2s in DMPC layer 20\*20 nm^2.**

Computed, plotted, analysed:
1. Lipid density versus thickness.
2. SASA versus time.
3. Gyration radii of Maleic acid monomers, Styrol monomers and both versus time.
4. Rotational ACF of myristoil atoms C11 C12 C13 (as template POPC where C15 C16 C17 were chosen in previous calculations).
